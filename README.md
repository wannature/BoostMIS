In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework named BoostMIS that combines adaptive pseudo labeling and informative active annotation to unleash the potential of medical image SSL models.

## üéì What‚Äôs In This Repo



The proposed dataset and framework implementations of our paper are as follows:

## Environment

- Python==3.9
- Pytorch==1.9.1
- Keras==2.2.2

## Dataset Statistic
[**Dataset link**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02533)

## Dataset 
Based on Tensorflow object detection API, we pick Faster R-CNN with Resnet101 architecture pre-trained on COCO dataset to detect region of interest (ROI).
