In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework named BoostMIS that combines adaptive pseudo labeling and informative active annotation to unleash the potential of medical image SSL models.

## üéì What‚Äôs In This Repo

The proposed dataset and framework implementations of our paper are as follows:

## Environment

- Python==3.7
- Pytorch==1.9.1
- cuda=10.2


## Dataset 
The MESCC dataset contains two classification task: two-grading and six-grading. 

The *-features.npy files are the MRI image features extracted from the pre-trained Resnet50 (from https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet50-19c8e357.pth).  

The *-targets.npy files are the labels for two-grading and six-grading. For two-grading, 0 and 1 are the low-grade and high-grade, respectively. For six grading, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 correspond to b0, b1a, b1b, b1c, b2 and b3, respectively.
